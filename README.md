# Hand-Writing-Detection
This program will take a picture of handwriting as input and then compare it to a data base of inputted writing samples to determine the sample its closest to

This is using a concept I learned recently in my summer Calculus 3 course. The goal is for the program to have 2 modes; Data Entering and Data Parsing. The data bolstering will add writing samples to the database whereas the utility will take input and determine whose writing it is.

*** Project in extremely early ideation and development ***





[PROJECT GOALS]

[COMPLETE]     Initial Image Processing : Run the image through filters such that it is smoothed out and noise is reduced when the image is converted to binary
[IN PROGRESS]             Image Parsing : Box each individual letter in the picture and seperate them into a list of individual images
[NOT STARTED]          Letter Detection : Detect what letter each image is in the list of images
[NOT STARTED]          Writing Analysis : Perform necesarry calculations and create the vector map in order to collect standardized datapoints from each letter
[NOT STARTED]         Data Organization : Organize data from writing analysis into list with each letter corresponding to a set of datapoints collected
[NOT STARTED]            Add Data Enter : Add feature that allows a writing sample to be entered to a data base that can be compared to later
[NOT STARTED]            Add Data Parse : Add feature that allows a writing sample to be compared to data base and detect whose writing it is
