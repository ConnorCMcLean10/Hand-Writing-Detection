# Hand-Writing-Detection
This program will take a picture of handwriting as input and then compare it to a data base of inputted user inputted writing samples to determine the sample its closest to

Using a concept I learned recently in my summer Calculus 3 course. The goal is for the program to have 2 modes; Data Bolstering and Utility. The data bolstering will add writing samples to the database whereas the utility will take input and determine whose writing it is.

Project in extremely early ideation and development





[PROJECT GOALS]

[COMPLETE]     Initial Image Processing : Run the image through filters such that it is smoothed out and noise is reduced when the image is converted to binary
[IN PROGRESS]             Image Parsing : Box each individual letter in the picture and seperate them into a list of individual images
[NOT STARTED]          Letter Detection : Detect what letter each image is in the list of images
[NOT STARTED]          Writing Analysis : Perform necesarry calculations and create the vector map in order to collect standardized datapoints from each letter
[NOT STARTED]         Data Organization : Organize data from writing analysis into list with each letter corresponding to a set of datapoints collected
[NOT STARTED]            Add Data Enter : Add feature that allows a writing sample to be entered to a data base that can be compared to later
[NOT STARTED]            Add Data Parse : Add feature that allows a writing sample to be compared to data base and detect whose writing it is
